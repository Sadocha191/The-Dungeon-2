Knight - Dialogue #1 (first meeting in the village)
1. "Welcome to the Village of the Four Peaks. The mountains stand like sentinels, good at hiding us from eyes, not from what waits beyond."
2. "See the portal at the center? It is not a gate. It is a wound in the world."
3. "It opens into the Abandoned Lands, where the ground remembers old wars and the air tastes of teeth."
4. "Out there, you roam freely. No corridors, no safe lanes. The horde gathers like a storm. The longer you endure, the thicker it becomes."
5. "Hold your ground for twenty minutes, and the land sends its ruler. A boss. If it falls, you return here a victor."
6. "If you fall, you still return. Lighter in pride, but not empty-handed."
7. "Before you step into that wound, go to the Blacksmith. Steel is the first promise you will need."

Blacksmith - Dialogue (weapons, coins, preparation)
1. "So the portal is humming again. It always hums when it is hungry."
2. "In the Abandoned Lands, the winner is not the bravest. It is the one who can carve breathing room." 
3. "Damage. Reach. Speed. A weapon is not a tool. It is space you buy with every swing."
4. "The monsters drop coins as they die. Bring those back, and I will turn them into steel that will not shatter in your hand."
5. "This is not one fight. It is a cycle: run, loot, return, improve. Each map bites harder than the last."
6. "Here. A simple sword. Let it be your first answer when the horde starts closing in."
7. "Come back after your runs. With enough coin, and a little luck, I will forge you something that matches your style."

Knight - Dialogue #2 (after weapon, sends to the witch)
1. "Good. Steel steadies the heart, for a moment."
2. "But the horde does not fight with honor. It does not give you room to breathe."
3. "That is why the village has another kind of weapon. The Witch does not forge iron. She forges control."
4. "Go to her. Take a spellbook. When the crowd becomes a wall, magic is how you make a door."

Witch - Dialogue (spells, effects, upgrades, level-up choices)
1. "Ah. A fresh soul with new steel. I can smell fear and ambition on you. Classic."
2. "Listen closely. You grow out there in two ways: by coin, and by experience."
3. "As you cut them down, they spill experience. Gather enough, and the world pauses, just long enough to offer you a choice."
4. "An upgrade. A new edge. More power, strange gifts, sometimes a price. Choose well."
5. "Spells you buy from me can appear among those choices during a run. Prepare here, and you shape what fate can offer you."
6. "And effects, fire, frost, curses, are not decoration. They are answers when your blade cannot keep up."
7. "Bring back your coins, and I will sharpen your magic: wider, faster, stronger. So the horde learns to hesitate."

Knight - Dialogue #3 (final, before entering the portal)
1. "You have steel from the Blacksmith, and the Witch's words in your head. Now comes the step that matters."
2. "Twenty minutes. That is what the Abandoned Lands give you before the boss comes to end the story."
3. "Kill it, and you return a victor. Fall short, and you return wiser."
4. "Either way, the village will measure your run: how long you lasted, how many you cut down, what you managed to find."
5. "Go. The portal is waiting. And the Four Peaks will still be here when you return."
